# Background
If you see the test data sets [here](https://github.com/JinJis/DACON-fake-news-identification/tree/main/web_scrapper/image/test_sets.png),  you will notice that each data point consists of `title` and `content`. The real data point hereby means the combination of a title and randomly picked sentence from the news article.

Meaning `set(real title, real content)` where `real_content = a sentence picked from real article`.

By analyzing the pattern of fake news training set, two features could be noticed.

1. Let's say authentic data = `set(real title, real content)`, then we can make fake news by adding `!` or `"` to the front or end of the content.
2. Shuffling. Let's say we have `set(news1 real title, news1 real content)`, `set(news2 real title, news2 real content)`. There is a pattern where fake news is generated by shuffling two sets of real news but mismatching title or content to each other. For example, we can make fake news by having real title from news1 but content from any sentence from news2.

# Objective
If we count real set over fake set, fake counts more than the real one. In every *Binary Classification* problem, this kind of situation is called `Class Imbalance`, and can have serious impact on training.

Thus we need to **synthetically generate fakes news** so that the ratio between real and fakes are as same as possible.

# Implementation
